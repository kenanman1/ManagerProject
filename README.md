# ManagerProject
The project is designed as a people management system, catering to the needs of a manager or administrator. The main functionality includes a dynamic table displaying information about individuals. The manager has the capability to perform various actions such as adding, deleting, and modifying entries in the table, providing a streamlined approach to people management. Additionally, the system offers a user registration feature, allowing individuals to sign up and make modifications to the shared table, creating a collaborative environment for data management.
